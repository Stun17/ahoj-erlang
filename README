Erlang interactive application which tells you about your pocket strengh in
Texas Holdem Poker card game

requirements: 

  - Erlang VM - to run application 
  - bash shell - to start/stop application only
  - ncat | sockat | _another_soft_  - to connect to udp unix-socket

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so start:

   $> ./quick.sh start

to stop:

   $> ./quick.sh stop

(NB: you should change the first bang-line according with your system bash-path)

to connect to socket:

   a) if you have ncat installed on your system then

     $> nc -u localhost 33355

   b) if y have socat installed on your system then

     $> socat - udp-connect:localhost:33355

after that you ask question via terminal in form:

     $> <rank><rank><s|u>

without any spaces in it. and you recieve the answer in form:

     <strenght for full table>  <strenght for Heads-Up>

strengh = 1 is neutral. more than that - "good", less than that - "bad"
actually this is ROI of this pocket, obtained through Monte-Carlo simulations

enjoy!
